From the moment we are born, till the day we die. We live moments, and share out brief time together.

Every morning the sun rises and every night the stars come. These stars are not just balls of gases burning billions of miles away, these are the reminder of the very small amount of time we spend on this beautiful planet. All these creations of nature are not only there to sooth our eyes, they are there to make you realise what is it feels like to be a human being.

When you are born on this planet you are making dozens of people happy by your presence. Your mother gave birth to you in the OR and the news spread so fast that now even those people have a smile stitched to their face who are hundreds of miles away form you. Isn't this beautiful? Your mother has gone through that pain and discomfort just to prove that creation is beautiful, just like when new buds come to a tree who has seen the harsh wintery nights to survive so that it can give birth to these fresh new buds.

Isn't life so beautiful? But then we as humans fail to see the beauty of nature to its core. We are always hustling and rushing from one place to another that we forgot to see that a leaf just died, the grass on the side pavement is turning grey, and the squirrels are filling their home with winter supply. And when the harsh winter are over there comes the spring, and we humans again fail to see that a new leaf is born, that the grass that was grey and dry is now green. The squirrel's family has increased, adding more members. All these things are invisible to us because we are too busy in them rat race that we forgot how beautiful life is, how beautiful nature is.

God has put wonders all around us, in the small things and in the big things. Its just about the perspective bye which you look at things.

Our life has become nothing but a pointless race, nobody stops and appreciates the wild flower or a bird's nest inside a mail box. We are given this opportunity.

I am not blaming any group here but every individual human being. From birth we are taught to run in the rat race and come first. Our classrooms are filled with empty lifeless walls, our bags filled with books and our heads full of dreams. Why nobody teaches about nature in schools? Why history is more important then life itself? Instead of all these things, our kids should be taught to be in touch with nature, to always observe the changes it unfolds.
